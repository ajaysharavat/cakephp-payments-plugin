# CakePHP Payments Plugin #

http://github.com/burzum/Payments

This plugin is thought to provide a generic API for different payment processors.

The idea is to wrap every payment processor into the same interface so that it becomes immediately usable by every developer who is familiar with this API eliminating the need to learn all the different payment providers and their specific APIs.

It might become possible that there will be an independent non CakePHP version too in the future.

Contributions are welcome!

## Requirements

 * CakePHP 2.x

### List of Payment Processors using this API

Please create a ticket on github or send me an email if you want to get your processor on that list.
